                <p>
                  Through my leadership roles at IIT Madras, I've transformed theoretical
                  education into practical, hands-on learning experiences across multiple domains.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My leadership philosophy centers around "learning by doing" - creating real-world
                  challenges that bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From managing placement processes to building product communities, I've built
                  thriving ecosystems that benefit thousands of students and drive measurable outcomes.
